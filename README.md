## Structure

This repo has a number of modules:
* **`ConnectSDK`** - provides an API for interacting with the Connect back-end
* **`NetworkClient`** - networking client used to send requests. Generated by our code generation tool `Tribble`
* **`ConnectSampleApp`** - sample application to act as the host app for testing the SDK during development
* **`ConnectTestApp`** - testing application used for running instrumented tests for the SDK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and a [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your machine.

### Environment setup

To be able to run the sample application, you are required to provide a Connect private API key.
Create or update your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` to include the following:

* `CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>`

## Testing

Please run all tests before opening a pull request. This can be done by running `./gradlew test`.
This will run both unit tests and instrumented tests, so you will need an Android device or emulator to be connected.
